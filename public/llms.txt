# MosqueSteps

> Turn every step into a blessing. Track your walk to the mosque and discover the spiritual rewards.

MosqueSteps is a free, privacy-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for Muslims who walk to the mosque. It tracks your walking journey using GPS and device sensors, shows accurate prayer times, calculates spiritual rewards (hasanat) based on authentic hadiths from Sahih Muslim and Sahih al-Bukhari, and helps you find nearby mosques via OpenStreetMap.
