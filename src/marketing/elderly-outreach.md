# MosqueSteps — Elderly & Senior Outreach Strategy

## Why Seniors Are Our Most Important Audience

### The Health Imperative
- **WHO (2022):** Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for death globally. For adults 65+, walking is the most recommended form of physical activity.
- **JAMA (2020):** For adults 60+, just 6,000-8,000 steps/day provides maximum mortality benefit (vs 10,000 for younger adults). That's achievable with 3-4 mosque walks.
- **BMJ (2021):** Regular walking reduces fall risk by 23% and hip fracture risk by 40% in seniors.
- **Alzheimer's Association:** Walking 30 minutes/day reduces dementia risk by up to 40%.

### The Social Isolation Crisis
- **National Academies of Sciences (2020):** 1 in 4 adults over 65 is socially isolated. Isolation increases mortality risk by 26%.
- **Age UK (2023):** 1.4 million older people in the UK report feeling lonely most or all of the time.
- **The mosque solves this:** 5 daily congregation prayers = 5 daily social contacts, structured and purposeful.

### The Spiritual Connection
- Elderly Muslims often have more time for worship but face mobility barriers
- Walking to the mosque provides both worship and exercise simultaneously
- The community checks on absent members — a built-in welfare system

## Understanding Elderly User Needs

### Physical Considerations
- Slower walking pace (3-4 km/h vs 5 km/h default)
- Shorter distances preferred (under 1 km)
- Rest stops may be needed
- Weather sensitivity (cold, heat, rain)
- Vision and hearing considerations for app usage

### Technology Considerations
- Larger text preferences
- Simple, uncluttered interfaces
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Family members may help with initial setup
- Prefer phone calls or in-person help over digital support

### Motivational Drivers
- Maintaining independence and mobility
- Social connection at the mosque
- Spiritual devotion and preparation for the hereafter
- Feeling useful and part of the community
- Health maintenance (doctor's recommendation to walk)
