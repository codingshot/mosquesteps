## Welcome (after first visit or install)

**Subject:** Your steps to the mosque count — here’s how to see them

Assalamu alaykum,

You’ve discovered MosqueSteps: the app that turns every step to the mosque into a visible blessing.

**Get started in 3 steps:**  
1. Open [mosquesteps.com](https://mosquesteps.com)  
2. Set your location (or use “Use current location”)  
3. Tap **Walk** when you’re ready to go to the mosque — we’ll track your steps and show your hasanat.

No account needed. Everything stays on your device.

The Prophet ﷺ said: *“Whoever purifies himself in his house then walks to one of the houses of Allah to perform an obligatory prayer, one step will erase a sin and another will raise him a degree.”* (Sahih Muslim 666)

Start your first walk → [mosquesteps.com](https://mosquesteps.com)

Barakallahu feek.

## Ramadan (start of Ramadan)

**Subject:** This Ramadan, count your steps to the mosque 🕌

Assalamu alaykum,

Ramadan is here. For many of us, that means more trips to the mosque — for Taraweeh, for Fajr, for Maghrib and Isha.

MosqueSteps helps you track every one of those walks: steps, distance, and the spiritual rewards the Prophet ﷺ promised for those who walk to the mosques in darkness.

**No account. No ads. Just you and your steps.**  
→ [mosquesteps.com](https://mosquesteps.com)

May this month be full of light and closeness to Allah.

## Ramadan (mid / last 10 nights)

**Subject:** Your walks this Ramadan — see your progress

Assalamu alaykum,

We’re deep into Ramadan. If you’ve been walking to the mosque, you’ve been earning rewards with every step.

Open MosqueSteps to see your walking history, streaks, and hasanat. If you haven’t tracked yet, it’s not too late — your next walk can be your first logged walk of the month.

May the last ten nights be especially blessed for you.

## Feature highlight (Leave-by time)

**Subject:** Never miss prayer time — get a “leave by” reminder

Assalamu alaykum,

Did you know MosqueSteps can tell you **when to leave** for the mosque so you arrive on time for prayer?

We use your walking distance and speed to calculate a “leave by” time for each prayer. Enable notifications in the app and we’ll remind you when it’s time to set off.

**Turn on reminders:**  
1. Open [mosquesteps.com](https://mosquesteps.com)  
2. Go to **Settings** (or Dashboard banner)  
3. Allow notifications when prompted  

One less thing to worry about. More time for the walk itself.
