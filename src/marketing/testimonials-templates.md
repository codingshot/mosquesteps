## Prompt to ask users for a quote

**Short ask (in-app or email):**  
“In one or two sentences, what do you like most about MosqueSteps? We might use your words (with your permission) on our website. Reply with your quote and first name + country/city if you’re happy to be credited.”

**Longer ask:**  
“Would you share a short testimonial? For example: how you use the app, what changed (e.g. walking more, feeling more motivated), or what you’d tell a friend. We’ll only use it with your permission and can use first name + city or ‘Anonymous’.”
