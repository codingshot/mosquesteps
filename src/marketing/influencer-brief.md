One-pager for Islamic content creators, fitness influencers, mosque admins, and community partners.

## What is MosqueSteps?

MosqueSteps is a **free web app** that helps Muslims who walk to the mosque to:

- **Track** their walk (steps, distance, time) in real time  
- **See prayer times** and a “leave by” time so they know when to set off  
- **Discover spiritual rewards** (hasanat) based on authentic hadiths (e.g. every step erases a sin and raises a degree)  
- **Find nearby mosques** on a map and save their usual mosque  
- **Earn badges and streaks** for consistency (e.g. 7-day streak, Fajr walker)

No account, no app store download — you open the link, allow location, and start. All data stays on the user’s device (privacy-first).

**Link:** https://mosquesteps.com

## Why it’s a fit for your audience

- **Faith + health:** Connects walking to prayer with step counting and hadith-based motivation.  
- **Habit-building:** Streaks and badges support consistency without being preachy.  
- **Universal:** Works for anyone who walks (or wants to walk) to the mosque — young, elderly, families.  
- **Trust:** No sign-up, no ads, no data sold; built by [ummah.build](https://ummah.build).

## What we’re asking

- **One post or story** (Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, etc.) that mentions or shows MosqueSteps.  
- **Honest experience:** Use the app yourself if you can (even one walk) and share what you like.  
- **Clear link:** Use https://mosquesteps.com so people can find it.

We’re not asking for a paid ad or scripted endorsement. We’re happy for you to say you’re trying it, or that you think your audience would find it useful.

## Key messages you can use (optional)

- “Every step to the mosque is a blessing — this app helps you see it.”  
- “Track your walk to the mosque: steps, prayer times, and spiritual rewards in one place.”
