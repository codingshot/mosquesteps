## Sunnah outline (the hadiths we built on)

Short outline you can paste or adapt for threads and posts:

- **Each step counts.** The Prophet ﷺ said: when you make wudu at home and walk to the mosque with no purpose except prayer, you don’t take a step except that Allah raises you a degree and removes a sin. *(Sahih Muslim 666)*
- **Walking in darkness = complete light.** Give glad tidings to those who walk to the mosques in darkness: they will have *perfect light* on the Day of Resurrection. *(Sunan Abi Dawud 561)* — Fajr and Isha.
- **Walk with calm.** When the iqamah is called, don’t come running. Come walking with tranquility. *(Sahih al-Bukhari 636)*
- **Farther = greater reward.** The people who receive the greatest reward for prayer are those who live farthest away. *(Sahih Muslim 662)*
- **Congregation matters.** Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer alone. *(Sahih Muslim 654)*
- **Walking to a mosque = immense reward.** (e.g. Quba = reward like Umrah; *(Ibn Majah 1412)* — we use the same principle for any mosque.)

**We built MosqueSteps so you can see these rewards:** track your steps, your distance, and your hasanat — all rooted in these hadiths. Free. No account. Open source.

## X (Twitter) — Founder announcement thread

**Tweet 1 (hook)**  
I built an app that turns every step to the mosque into a visible blessing.  
No account. No ads. Completely open source.  
Here’s why and what you can do with it 🧵

**Tweet 2 (problem)**  
The Prophet ﷺ said: you don’t take one step to the mosque except Allah raises you a degree and removes a sin. (Muslim 666)  
Most of us walk and never *see* that. I wanted to change that.

**Tweet 3 (what it is)**  
MosqueSteps: a free PWA that tracks your walk to the mosque.  
• Steps & distance (GPS + sensors)  
• Prayer times + “leave by” time so you’re never late  
• Hasanat counter based on the same hadith  
• Mosque finder (OpenStreetMap)  
• All data stays on your phone

**Tweet 4 (sunnah)**  
We didn’t make up the rewards. Every number ties back to hadith:  
• Muslim 666 — step = sin erased + degree raised  
• Abi Dawud 561 — walking in darkness → complete light (Fajr/Isha)  
• Bukhari 636 — walk with tranquility  
• Muslim 662 — farther walk = greater reward  
All linked to Sunnah.com in the app.

**Tweet 5 (open source & test)**  
100% open source. No backend. No tracking.  
Repo: github.com/codingshot/mosquesteps  
I’d love for you to try it and tell me what breaks or what’s missing:  
• Step tracking (walk to your mosque)  
• Prayer times & leave-by alerts  
• Mosque finder & saved mosque  
• Rewards & badges  
mosquesteps.com

**Tweet 6 (CTA)**  
If you walk to the masjid — or want to start — give it a try.  
One link. No install from an app store.  
Turn every step into a blessing.

Jazakum Allahu khayran for the support. 🤲

## X — Short “Sunnah outline” thread (hadith-only)

**1**  
A short thread on the hadiths behind walking to the mosque — and why we built an app around them 🧵

**2**  
Muslim 666: When you make wudu at home and walk to the mosque for prayer, you don’t take a step except Allah raises you a degree and removes a sin.  
Every. Single. Step.

**3**  
Abi Dawud 561: Give glad tidings to those who walk to the mosques *in darkness* — they will have perfect light on the Day of Resurrection.  
Fajr and Isha walks carry this promise.

**4**  
Bukhari 636: When the iqamah is called, don’t come running. Come walking with tranquility.  
We even remind you in the app if you’re walking too fast.

**5**  
Muslim 662: The people who get the *greatest* reward for prayer are those who live farthest away.  
Distance isn’t a burden — it’s more reward.

**6**  
We built MosqueSteps so you can see these rewards: steps, distance, hasanat — all tied to these hadiths. Free, no account, open source.

## LinkedIn — Founder announcement (post)

**Title:** I built an app so we can see the reward of every step to the mosque

**Body:**  
The Prophet ﷺ said that when you make wudu at home and walk to the mosque for prayer, you don’t take a step except that Allah raises you a degree and removes a sin (Sahih Muslim 666). Most of us walk — but we never *see* that reward.

I built **MosqueSteps** to change that: a free, privacy-first web app that tracks your walk to the mosque, shows prayer times and a “leave by” time, finds nearby mosques, and calculates spiritual rewards (hasanat) based on authentic hadiths. Every reference in the app links to Sunnah.com.

**What I’d love from you:** try it and tell me what to improve. Things to test: step tracking (GPS + device sensors), prayer-time alerts, mosque finder, and the rewards/badges. The project is **completely open source** (GitHub: codingshot/mosquesteps) — no account, no ads, no data sent to servers. Everything stays on your device.

If you walk to the masjid — or want to start — you can use it here: **mosquesteps.com**

Jazakum Allahu khayran. Built with faith and open-source technology by ummah.build.

## Email / newsletter — Founder announcement (short)

**Subject:** I built an app so you can see the reward of every step to the mosque

Assalamu alaykum,

The Prophet ﷺ said that each step to the mosque erases a sin and raises a degree (Sahih Muslim 666). I wanted that reward to be visible — so I built **MosqueSteps**.

It’s a free web app that tracks your walk to the mosque (steps, distance, hasanat), shows prayer times and a “leave by” time, and helps you find nearby mosques. Every reward is based on hadiths you can check on Sunnah.com. No account, no ads, and **completely open source** (GitHub: codingshot/mosquesteps).

I’d love you to try it and tell me what to improve: step tracking, prayer alerts, mosque finder, or rewards. Everything runs in your browser; data stays on your device.

**Try it:** mosquesteps.com

Jazakum Allahu khayran.

## Features to test (checklist for testers)

Share this list when asking people to try the app:

- [ ] **Step tracking** — Start a walk, go to your mosque (or simulate). Do steps/distance update? Does it use sensor or GPS?
- [ ] **Prayer times** — Are times correct for your location? Is the “leave by” time shown and sensible?
- [ ] **Leave-by alerts** — Enable notifications. Do you get a reminder before it’s time to leave?
- [ ] **Mosque finder** — Does it find your mosque? Can you save it as primary? Does distance/steps update?
- [ ] **Rewards & badges** — After a walk, do hasanat and badges update? Do hadith links open correctly?
- [ ] **History & stats** — Do past walks show in History? Do Stats and charts look correct?
- [ ] **Settings** — Location, units (km/mi), theme, notifications — do they save and apply?
- [ ] **PWA** — Add to home screen. Does it work offline (e.g. last screen or cached)?
- [ ] **Open source** — Check GitHub (codingshot/mosquesteps). Can you find the code for a feature you used?

**Where to report:** GitHub Issues (bug report / feature request) or reply to the founder. Mention “founder announcement tester” if you want.
