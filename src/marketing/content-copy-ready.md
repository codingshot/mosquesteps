### Thread 1: "Why I stopped driving to the mosque"

**Tweet 1 (hook):** I used to drive 5 minutes to the mosque. Then I discovered it's only 12 minutes on foot. Here's what changed. 🧵

**Tweet 2:** I tracked my first walk. 1,847 steps. 2,100 hasanat (based on Sahih Muslim 666). I had no idea I was leaving that much reward on the table.

**Tweet 3:** The "leave by" time changed everything. I know exactly when to leave for Fajr. No more rushing. No more stress.

**Tweet 4:** Now I walk to 3–4 prayers a day. That's 6,000+ steps. My doctor is happy. My heart is happy. And I can *see* the spiritual reward.

**Tweet 5:** The app is free. No sign-up. No account. I just opened the link and started. That's it.

**Tweet 6:** If your mosque is under 20 minutes away, try walking once. Track it. See what you've been missing.

### Thread 2: "5 myths about walking to the mosque"

**Tweet 1:** "It's too far." "The weather." "I don't have time."
I've heard them all. Here are 5 myths about walking to the mosque — and what the Sunnah (and science) actually say. 🧵

**Tweet 2:** Myth 1: "My mosque is too far."
Reality: Many mosques are 10–15 min on foot. We just never checked. Open MosqueSteps, find yours. You might be surprised.

**Tweet 3:** Myth 2: "Walking takes too long."
Reality: Driving + parking often takes the same or longer. A 15-min walk = 15 min. No traffic, no parking stress.

**Tweet 4:** Myth 3: "I'll be tired for prayer."
Reality: Walking *improves* focus. The Prophet ﷺ walked. The Sahabah walked. Your body adapts.

**Tweet 5:** Myth 4: "I can't in winter/rain."
Reality: Layer up. Bring an umbrella. Millions walk in worse. The reward doesn't change with the weather.

**Tweet 6:** Myth 5: "I need to drive to make it on time."
Reality: MosqueSteps shows your "leave by" time based on distance. You'll never miss prayer — and you'll walk.

**Tweet 7:** Try one walk. Track it. See the steps. See the hasanat. Then decide.

### Thread 3: Hadith breakdown — Walking to the mosque

**Tweet 1:** The Prophet ﷺ said remarkable things about walking to the mosque. Here are 5 hadiths that will change how you see your walk. 🧵

**Tweet 2:** 1. "One step erases a sin, another raises a degree." (Muslim 666)
Every. Single. Step. You're not just moving — you're being purified and elevated.

**Tweet 3:** 2. "Give glad tidings to those who walk in darkness... of complete light on the Day of Resurrection." (Abu Dawud 561)
Fajr and Isha walkers: this is for you.

**Tweet 4:** 3. "The people who receive the greatest reward are those farthest away." (Muslim 662)
The longer the walk, the greater the reward. Your distance is a blessing.

**Tweet 5:** 4. "Walk with calmness and dignity." (Bukhari 636)
Your walk *is* worship. The pace, the intention — it all matters.

**Tweet 6:** 5. We built an app so you can see these rewards. Track your steps. See your hasanat. No sign-up.
