# MosqueSteps — Campaign Ideas & Creative Briefs

## Campaign 1: "The Mosque Next Door"

### Concept
Highlight the privilege of having a mosque within walking distance. Create emotional contrast with Muslims who don't have this blessing.

### Key Messages
- "Your mosque is 800 meters away. For 1 billion Muslims, the nearest one is hours."
- "Don't drive past a blessing — walk to it."
- "The distance between you and the mosque is the distance between you and thousands of hasanat."

### Creative Executions
- **Video:** Split screen — one Muslim walking 10 minutes to their mosque, another driving 2 hours to reach theirs
- **Infographic:** World map showing mosque density vs Muslim population
- **Social cards:** "Distance to my mosque: 0.8 km. Hasanat per walk: 2,100. Excuse to drive: 0."
- **User stories:** Muslims sharing their walking distance + gratitude

### Channels
- Instagram Reels / TikTok (emotional video content)
- Twitter/X threads with mosque access statistics
- Mosque bulletin boards (printed infographic)

- Monthly recognition of most consistent walkers

### Key Messages

## Campaign 3: "Prescribed by Your Doctor and Your Prophet ﷺ"

### Concept
Bridge modern medicine with Prophetic tradition. Walking to the mosque is simultaneously medical advice and Sunnah practice.

### Key Messages
- "Your cardiologist says: walk 30 min/day. Your Prophet ﷺ says: walk to the mosque. Same prescription."
- "The WHO recommends 150 min of walking/week. Five daily prayers deliver 100+ min."
- "Science caught up to the Sunnah — 1,400 years late."

### Creative Executions
- **Side-by-side cards:** Medical journal quote next to hadith, showing alignment
- **Infographic:** "What doctors recommend" vs "What the Sunnah prescribes" — identical outcomes
- **Testimonial format:** "After my heart surgery, my doctor said walk daily. My imam said the same thing. MosqueSteps tracks both prescriptions."

### Target Audiences
- People with chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, obesity)
- Post-surgery recovery patients
- Sedentary office workers
- Elderly with doctor recommendations to exercise

## Campaign 4: "Never Too Old, Never Too Far"

### Concept
Elderly-focused campaign emphasizing that every step counts, regardless of pace or distance.

### Key Messages

- "Your slowest walk earns the same hasanat as the fastest."
- "Independence is walking to prayer on your own terms."
- "At your pace, every step carries more weight — in health and in reward."

### Creative Executions
- **Video:** Elderly man slowly walking to Fajr, passing younger people in cars. He arrives. Caption: "He earned more than all of them."
- **Photo series:** Elderly hands holding a phone showing MosqueSteps. "My son set this up for me. Now I know my steps count."
- **Printed material:** Large-font mosque flyers: "Track your blessed walk — ask your grandchild to help you set up"

- "Dark outside. Light inside. Walk to Fajr."

## Campaign 6: "The Living Da'wah"

### Concept
When non-Muslims see Muslims calmly walking to the mosque, it's a form of da'wah (invitation). Your visible walk normalizes Islam in the community.

### Key Messages
