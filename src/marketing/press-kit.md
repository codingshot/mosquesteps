# MosqueSteps — Press Kit

## Boilerplate (short)

**MosqueSteps** is a free, privacy-first Progressive Web App that helps Muslims track their walk to the mosque, view prayer times, and see spiritual rewards (hasanat) based on authentic hadiths. No account required; data stays on your device.

## Boilerplate (medium, ~100 words)

MosqueSteps is a free web app for Muslims who walk to the mosque. Users can track steps and distance in real time, view accurate prayer times for their location, and discover the spiritual rewards of walking to prayer as described in Sahih Muslim, Bukhari, and other authenticated sources. The app includes a mosque finder powered by OpenStreetMap, “leave by” alerts based on walking time, and gamification with badges and streaks. MosqueSteps is a PWA: installable, works offline, and stores all data locally. Built by [ummah.build](https://ummah.build). No login, no ads, no tracking.
