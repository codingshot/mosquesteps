# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone who contributes to or uses MosqueSteps, regardless of age, background, or belief.

## Expected behavior

- **Be respectful** — Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Disagreement is fine; personal attacks are not.
- **Be constructive** — Focus on the code, the product, and the issue at hand. Help others learn and improve.
- **Welcome newcomers** — Open source depends on new contributors. Assume good intent and help people get started.
- **Stay on topic** — Keep discussions relevant to MosqueSteps. Avoid divisive or off-topic debates.
- **Respect Islamic diversity** — MosqueSteps serves a global Muslim audience. We do not promote one school of thought over another in the app or in project communication.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, trolling, or discriminatory language
- Personal or political attacks
- Doxxing or sharing others’ private information without consent
- Spam or offtopic promotion
- Any conduct that would be unacceptable in a professional or community setting

## Enforcement

Maintainers may edit or remove content (issues, comments, PRs) that violate this code. Repeated or serious violations may result in being blocked from the repository. We will do our best to be fair and to communicate clearly.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open an issue (you can make it private if the repo allows) or contact the maintainers. We will treat reports confidentially and take them seriously.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to project spaces (GitHub repo, issues, PRs, discussions) and to public communication about the project (e.g. official social accounts).
